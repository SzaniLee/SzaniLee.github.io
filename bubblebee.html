				<p>Bubble Bee is a locally owned and operated business in Arizona that sells the popular Asian Bubble Tea drinks, served in their unique fat cups. Bubble Bee strives to be different from other local boba shops so they offer a wide variety of 70+ drink combinations with unique flavors and hot bubble tea drinks. The business also emphasizes the importance of their quality USDA approved quality organic ingredients. </p>

				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Challenge</h3>	 		
				<p>
				<ul><li>Bubble Bee wants to <b>create a fully responsive website</b> where customers can learn about them, can get information about their products and online ordering options.
</li>
				<li><b>Develop or extend coherent branding</b> that aligns with the shop’s current and/or desired customer experience. </li>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Market Research</h3>
					<p>I conducted market research first to gather information about the business and the bubble tea industry itself by relying on market analysis forecast reports, demographics articles and reports about current trends as well. The research showed how most <b>customers research online before choosing a boba shop to visit</b> because there are many bubble tea places with the same offerings. This is a great opportunity for Bubble Bee to have a website where they canshare their organic & more unique approach to the bubble tea drinks and with that attract more customers by estabilishing a stronger online presence and emphasizing how they stand out of the crowd.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>I looked into who the competitors of Bubble Bee are to understand the industry standards by pointing out the strenghts and weaknesses of direct and indirect competitors. <b>I developed an understanding of how other bubble tea websites design for their users and how they solve problems for similar user needs</b>. I chose the direct competitors by searching for other popular local shops in the area that sell bubble tea and/or have similar concept to Bubble Bee.  As for indirect competitors, I chose businesses that sell similar yet different products, but satisfying the same user needs.</p>

I interviewed 5 people in person at the Scottsdale location of Bubble Bee. I asked open-ended questions about their experiences with Bubble Bee both online and offline, how they generally go about searching for bubble tea shops, why they decided to choose Bubble Bee and their way of placing an order as well. </b> </p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Strategy: Business & User Goals + Product Roadmap</h3>
					<p>To help achieve business stated goals with the experience of the product, I had to focus on the UX strategy plan first. Defining the UX strategy involved planning the requirements around both the user goals and the stakeholder business strategies. <b>I identified the shared goals of the business and the user in order to make better design decisions</b>. Then to communicate our UX strategy, I put together a <b>Product Roadmap document</b>, which is a high level strategic document. I prioritized the user goals and <b>identified features that could help meet user goals and solve the problems.</b> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZxyB7XSEkKC0SlfxVULTF-jr9qob_Ki/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color: #16152b;"><span class="highlight"> View Product Roadmap</a></span>.

		<div class="market">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Architecture: Sitemap</h3>
					<p>Moving forward, based on the product roadmap and research findings, I created the sitemap of the website <b>to have the content organized and to visualize how the information can be structured</b>. The main pages are indicated with the dark grey colored boxes while the yellow ones indicate the subpages. I researched how the competitors of Bubble Bee built their websites and I decided to have ours built in a similar and simple way to help users navigate through the website efficiently.

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">User Flow</h3>
					<p>I created a User Flow diagram to visualize <b>how Amy can complete different tasks in different ways to achieve her goals and how she would navigate through the website</b>. I created two scenarios for Amy based on research findings and built flows including site pages, decision points, actions and external pages. Since one of Amy's needs is to check what the store has to offer prior visiting, I focused on this particular task first. She wants to check the menu and find a drink that she would enjoy consuming. Another task includes two other needs of her, which are to find out the source of key ingredients and to validate her desire to go. These needs can be satisfied by completing the given task in Scenario 2.

					<p>Then I created a Task flow <b>to map out the user journey for a single key task, which was to find a drink to order</b>. This task would be completed most likely the same way by the majority of the users. Both the user flows and task flows are needed to create a better user experience for customers and guranatee a perfect flow for them.

							<li>Add backwards link or breadcrumbs in the Find Your Drink feature in each steps to be able to correct themselves without needing to start everything all over</li>

				<p>To showcase the brand identity and visual design direction of Bubble Bee, I created a <b> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYg58bNHEorlbbKt_9aEkcczTA6Mmp-v/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">style tile</a></span></a></b> which helped me expanding the existing branding of the business while keeping their value and image that they have estabilished. I created a <b>new logo</b> for the business as I wanted to show a different approach to it and the business was open to any new logo ideas. I kept the existing yellow + black brand colors and introduced a new highlight color and chose fonts that match the brand adjectives which are the following: Creative, Modern, Inviting, Fun, Unique, Bold.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p>Designing a responsive website from scratch is always challenging, especially if it's for a well-estabilished business like Bubble Bee is. This project helped me understand how important it is to define the core problems the right way. If I didn't do my research thoroughly and if I skipped the POV Statements + HMW Questions, I might have not implemented a "Find Your Drink" feature or would have designed the menu in a different way, which would have been still be confusing for customers. I was able to think outside the box and find ideal solutions to the problems that I was able to define. </p>

						<div  class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
							
								<h1>Next Steps</h1>
								<uL>
								
								<li>Conduct more rounds of usability testings with the high-fidelity prototype.</li>
								<li>Keep making improvements on the design based on user feedbacks for a better user experience.</li>
								<li>Prepare all deliverables for handoff.</li>
