				<p>Zeit is a subsidiary of Richard Branson’s Virgin empire. After a long struggle with Elon Musk, Virgin has been able to make time travel tourism available to all with Zeit. A total of 289 destinations all over the world, up from prehistoric times through today, have been approved and finalized to receive people any moment. Zeit wanted to make the selling of the tickets as easy as possible.</p>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Market Research</h3>
					<p>I conducted a market research <b>to get a better picture of the tourism field and consumers</b>. Since Zeit is the very first time travel website, I couldn't gather already existing information of the time travel industry, which was very challenging. However, by focusing on the ordinary travel industry, I gathered valuable market and demographics findings that are rooted in data and statistics. I could collect the common trends and pain points of online travel booking websites as well. <b>This secondary research method allowed me to gain an understanding of potential needs of travelers</b>.</p>

I identified a few direct and indirect competitors and pointed out their strengths and weaknesses in order to be able to position Zeit in the market. </p>

				<p><b>To gather qualitative information and empathize with users</b>, I conducted user interviews as my primary research method. I interviewed 7 frequent travelers and asked mostly open-ended questions about their travel and booking experiences. I could highlight common and very similar needs, desires and frustrations among the participants' answer, which <b>helped me understand user habits, behaviour and feelings better</b>. </p>

					<p>I conducted an <b>open card sorting technique with 5 participants</b> to see how potential users organize content naturally and to uncover new perspectives. I asked the participants to group 30 cards in any way they wanted to.

					<p><b>Findings:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Most participants grouped cards based on location (continents), time period (eras) and culture</li>
						<li>Most participants grouped cards generally on the era as well. For example, all participants labeled one group of cards as “Ancient Times / Civilization”, “Modern Era”, “Renaissance Era” etc. Some participants got more specific and they titled the groups by a specific time period “14-15th century”, “Early 20th Century”, “Modern 20th Century” , “ Early Modern Europe” etc</li>
						<li>3 participants created a category specifically titled as US History / Events</li>

				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low-fidelity Sketches</h3>
					<p>As the first step of designing the interface of Zeit, I created a few different low-fidelity sketches of the Homepage to go through some ideations regarding mainly the navigation, content and layout of the website based on my insights. By sketching my ideas out on paper first before going digital, it allowed me <b>to brainstorm multiple visual directions quickly and efficiently before sticking to one.</b> </p>

				<div class="designmargin">
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Mid-fidelity wireframes</h3>
					<p>Next, I digitized the wireframes in Figma and had them as visual guides that <b>represents the skeletal framework of the pages of a Zeit</b>. The Homepage, Deals page and Trip Details pages were wireframed first as these pages are necessary for the trip browsing and choosing experience. The wireframes are <b>responsive</b>, which means that Zeit is optimal for viewing on a wide range of devices & web browsers (mobile, tablet, desktop).

						<div class="market">
				
				<ul class="wow slideInUp">
					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Brand Style tile</h3>
					<p>I started building Zeit's visual identity by identifying the main brand adjectives that would represent the company: <i>Modern, Historical, Bright, Friendly, Innovative, Fresh</i>. I browsed on Pinterest for some inspiration and created a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/szanileeux/zeit-brand-ideas/" style="color: #16152b;"><span class="highlight">mood board</a></span></li> to have a collection of different kinds of inspiration for the look and feel of my website. </a> The brand style tile was helping me <b>to keep consistency in my design and to showcase the color, typography, image and logo choices</b> for Zeit's brand.</p><br> 
						<p>As for the logo and the entire <a href="https://docdro.id/b8pChnb" style="color: #16152b;"><span class="highlight">logo creation process</a></span></li>, I started brainstorming based on the brand adjectives and I incorporated elements of the ancient pillar,clock/time and old ancient paper into it to have it historical but modern at the same time. </p>

I needed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10A0_8VBBgMUJgr8RHyD-_viyOjWC7NPgXxjzGBZVPz4/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">test plan</a></span> to guide me before I conducted the test so I identified the test objectives, the subject, chose the test methdology, defined paticipants and two different scenarios with a few tasks to complete.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Affinity Map</h3>
					<p>Next, I created an affinity map where I gathered the findings from the usability testing and sorted the feedbacks into different categories. Based on the insights and recommendations, <b>I was able to create a guideline to the priority revisions</b> on my prototype. The affinity map helped me find out what could I could <b>improve on the website for a better user experience</b>.</p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Iteration</h3>
					<p>After having prioritized the recommendations in the affinity map, I updated the website design and prototype. I implemented changes to the "sort by" function on the Deals page and also added a filter function as well. On the homepage I removed the carousel in the Best Deals section and added a new CTA button, which navigates users to the actual Deals page. The previous and revised versions of the Deals page and Homepage are shown below. <a href="https://invis.io/EJRQ8Y2S6AX" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">Interact with the Prototype here</a></span> </p>

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Handoff - UI Kit + Zeplin</h3>
					<p>I put together a UI document <b>to share UI elements and patterns</b> with other designers or develpers on the team. I <b>designed all of the associated states of certain comps</b>, how certain elements behave when they are active, inactive or hovered over. Then with the help of <b>Zeplin</b>, I prepared <a href="zpl.io/29wMNly" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">handoff delieverables</a></span></p> to make my design work as clear and understandable for a developer as possible.

								<h1>Reflection</h1>
								<p><b>What I would do different</b> if I could work on this project all over again in the exact given time frame is to get back to the prototype and testing phase to extend it with a new task related to the booking process. I should have tested in the first round of usability testing whether the users are able to get through the 5-step checkout system or not. I have planned to do it when I put together my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TdpN7QcPhkfTHmc8Oeq_mEaoMZ3WG-05ACINAT4_UzQ/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:#16152b;"><span class="highlight">UI requirement document</a></span> since I was building an e-commerce website so the booking system plays an important role, however I didn't have time to build the pages to it. Except that, I am satisfied with the overall test results as I was focusing on how the users of Zeit can easily find the best trips/deals of their preference that would result in 100% customer satisfaction regarding the trip experience, which was an important goal for both my persona and the company itself. Next time, I will definitely prioritize features/my tasks better and will test the most important ones if my time is cut short!</p>

							<p><b>Research is key to a successful user experience</b>. It is easy to make assumptions when we are designing a product but if we can't validate our hypotheses and back up our design decisions with data then most likely our product won't solve the right problems for the users and it won't be as valuable to them. My long hours of researching ensured that the potential users of Zeit stay at the center of my entire design process, and I could give purpose to everything from Zeit's design to its usability. </p>

							<p><b>Overall</b>, I gained a great understanding of how important it is to empathize with potential users on a deeper level in order to design a successful product. I also gained valuable knowledge about designing an e-commerce website. Since Zeit is a time travel website, <b>this project was quite challenging</b> as I had to find my way to create a product that has never existed before. I do believe that this project helped me prepare a bit for how to identify and solve problems in any innovative environment. </p>
